Python Supermarket Checkout Simulator

This is a simple terminal program that simulates a supermarket checkout.

It lets users add products with quantities and prices, then generates a detailed purchase ticket including IVA (VAT).

For payment, it offers cash or card, and calculates change for cash payments.

I built this project to practice core Python skills like loops, dictionaries, functions, and handling user input, along with basic input validation.
